The completed group project for CS 315 at University of Puget Sound

This project was a rough Katamari Damacy clone that involves a robot standing on a ball. The ball and robot are then
controlled by the player through the levels to collect other balls of varying color. If the player runs into a ball
that is larger than itself, the player will lose. 

If the player decides that the level of play is too simple, they can increase the difficulty. Winnings conditions are met
when all of the opposing balls are absorbed by the player.
