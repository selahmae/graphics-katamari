The completed group project for CS 315 at University of Puget Sound

This project was a rough Katamari Damacy clone that involves a robot standing on a ball. The ball and robot is then
controlled by the player through the levels to collect other balls of varying color. If the player runs into a ball
that is larger than itself, the player will lose.
